# Sockets With React

This project was created in order to implement and test the Socket.IO node package with a React front-end.

## Instructions

These instructions assume that you have some experience in using the command line interface.

Even if you don't, now is a great time to start learning.

You will also need to have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed.

### Installing the Dependencies

To run this application you will have to install the dependencies with the following command,

```
yarn install

// or

yarn
```

Don't have yarn?

you can get it [here!](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)

or you can install the dependencies using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), just make sure to delete the yarn.lock file first.

```
npm install
```

### Running the Application

After installing your dependecies, run the following script

```
npm run sockets-test
```

This script runs the server script and the React script [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently) (see what I did there? ;p ).
